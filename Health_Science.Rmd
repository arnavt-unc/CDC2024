# Analyzing Health Science Data and Travel Patterns

This analysis focuses on deaths due to pneumonia, flu, or COVID-19 in U.S. states between 2020 and 2023. We supplement the analysis with travel data from quarterly reports to identify possible correlations between these health outcomes and travel behavior.

## Loading and Cleaning Data

We start by loading the health science dataset and removing rows with missing values to ensure clean data for downstream analysis.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(corrplot)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(gridExtra)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE}
health <- read_csv("HealthScienceData.csv")
health
health_full_clean <- na.omit(health)
health_full_clean
```
```{r}
filtered <- health_full_clean[health_full_clean$`Age Group` != "All Ages", ]
filtered$Quarter <- ifelse(filtered$MMWRweek <= 13, 1,
                     ifelse(filtered$MMWRweek <= 25, 2,
                     ifelse(filtered$MMWRweek <= 38, 3, 4)))
colnames(filtered) <- gsub(" ", "", colnames(filtered))
colnames(filtered) <- gsub("-", "", colnames(filtered))
colnames(filtered) <- gsub(",", "_", colnames(filtered))
filtered$AgeGroup <- factor(filtered$AgeGroup)
filtered

filtered2 <- filtered[!filtered$Jurisdiction %in% c("United States", "HHS Region 1", "HHS Region 2", "HHS Region 3","HHS Region 4", "HHS Region 5", "HHS Region 6", "HHS Region 7", "HHS Region 8", "HHS Region 9", "HHS Region 10"), ]
filtered2
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Before modeling, we explore the dataset to understand the deaths caused by pneumonia, flu, or COVID-19, and how these vary by state and time period. We use quarters as time periods to prepare for analysis with flight passenger data.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 3)) 
for (var in names(filtered2)[c(11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16)]) {
  boxplot(as.formula(paste(var, "~ AgeGroup")), data = filtered2, main = var)
}
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 3)) 
for (var in names(filtered2)[c(11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16)]) {
  boxplot(as.formula(paste(var, "~ Jurisdiction")), data = filtered2, main = var)
}
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 3)) 
for (var in names(filtered2)[c(11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16)]) {
  boxplot(as.formula(paste(var, "~ MMWRyear")), data = filtered2, main = var)
}
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)

health %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc((as.numeric('Total Deaths')))) %>%
  select('Jurisdiction', 'Total Deaths', 'MMWRyear')
```

## Visualizing Health Outcomes

We create visualizations such as bar charts and line graphs to display trends in health-related deaths across states. These help to identify patterns over the quarters.


```{r}
total_deaths_by_quarter <- filtered2 %>%
  group_by(Quarter) %>%
  summarize(TotalDeaths = sum(TotalDeaths))

ggplot(total_deaths_by_quarter, aes(x = Quarter, y = TotalDeaths)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Total Deaths by Quarter", x = "Quarter", y = "Total Deaths") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
filtered_region <- filtered[filtered$Jurisdiction %in% c("HHS Region 1", "HHS Region 2", "HHS Region 3","HHS Region 4", "HHS Region 5", "HHS Region 6", "HHS Region 7", "HHS Region 8", "HHS Region 9", "HHS Region 10"), ]

filtered_region$Jurisdiction <- factor(filtered_region$Jurisdiction, levels = c("HHS Region 1", "HHS Region 2", "HHS Region 3","HHS Region 4", "HHS Region 5", "HHS Region 6", "HHS Region 7", "HHS Region 8", "HHS Region 9", "HHS Region 10"))

total_deaths_by_region_and_quarter <- filtered_region %>%
  group_by(Jurisdiction, Quarter) %>%
  summarize(TotalDeaths = sum(Pneumonia_Influenza_orCOVID19Deaths, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(total_deaths_by_region_and_quarter, aes(x = Quarter, y = TotalDeaths, fill = Jurisdiction)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Total Deaths by Quarter and Region", x = "Quarter", y = "Total Deaths") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")

```

```{r}
total_deaths_by_year_quarter <- filtered_region %>%
  group_by(MMWRyear, Quarter, Jurisdiction) %>%
  summarize(TotalDeaths = sum(Pneumonia_Influenza_orCOVID19Deaths, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

years <- unique(total_deaths_by_year_quarter$MMWRyear)
plot_list <- list()

for (year in years) {
  year_data <- total_deaths_by_year_quarter %>%
    filter(MMWRyear == year)
  
  p <- ggplot(year_data, aes(x = Quarter, y = TotalDeaths, fill = Jurisdiction)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + 
    labs(title = paste("Total Deaths by Quarter and Region in", year),
         x = "Quarter",

    theme_minimal() +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")
  
  plot_list[[as.character(year)]] <- p
}
grid.arrange(grobs = plot_list, ncol = 2, nrow = 2)
```

```{r}
disease_columns <- c("COVID19Deaths", "PneumoniaDeaths", "InfluenzaDeaths")
par(mfrow = c(3, 4))
for (disease in disease_columns) {
  deaths_by_year_quarter <- filtered_region %>%
    group_by(MMWRyear, Quarter, Jurisdiction) %>%
    summarize(DiseaseDeaths = sum(.data[[disease]], na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')
  years <- unique(total_deaths_by_year_quarter$MMWRyear)

}}
```
```{r}

    plot_list[[disease]] <- p
  }

  grid.arrange(grobs = plot_list, ncol = 3)
}


```

## Flight and Travel Data

Next, we look at the filtered dataset containing flight data and passengers. We want to look at the destinations of flights and the number of passengers going to these destinations. We use bar graphs and analyze this data by HHS region as well, so that we can attempt to correlate with the health outcomes data.


```{r}
business_data <- read_csv("FilteredBusinessDataset.csv")
flights <- business_data[order(business_data$Year, business_data$quarter),]
head(flights)
```

```{r}
flights2020 <- filter(flights, Year == 2020)
filtered_2020 <- flights2020[flights2020$quarter %in% c("1", "2", "3", "4"), ]

filtered_2020$quarter <- factor(filtered_2020$quarter, levels = c("1", "2", "3" ,"4"))

flights2020_by_quarter <- filtered_2020 %>%
  group_by(Year, quarter) %>%
  summarize(passengers = sum(passengers, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(flights2020_by_quarter, aes(x = quarter, y = passengers/100000, fill = quarter)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Total Flyers by Quarter in the US in 2020", x = "Quarter", y = "Total Passengers in Millions") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")
```

```{r}
flights2021 <- filter(flights, Year == 2021)
filtered_2021 <- flights2021[flights2021$quarter %in% c("1", "2", "3", "4"), ]

filtered_2021$quarter <- factor(filtered_2021$quarter, levels = c("1", "2", "3" ,"4"))

flights2021_by_quarter <- filtered_2021 %>%
  group_by(Year, quarter) %>%
  summarize(passengers = sum(passengers, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(flights2021_by_quarter, aes(x = quarter, y = passengers/100000, fill = quarter)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Total Flyers by Quarter in the US in 2021", x = "Quarter", y = "Total Passengers by Millions") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")
```
```{r}
flights2022 <- filter(flights, Year == 2022)
filtered_2022 <- flights2022[flights2022$quarter %in% c("1", "2", "3", "4"), ]

  labs(title = "Total Flyers by Quarter in the US in 2022", x = "Quarter", y = "Total Passengers by Millions") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")
```
```{r}
flights2023 <- filter(flights, Year == 2023)
filtered_2023 <- flights2023[flights2023$quarter %in% c("1", "2", "3", "4"), ]

filtered_2023$quarter <- factor(filtered_2023$quarter, levels = c("1", "2", "3" ,"4"))

flights2023_by_quarter <- filtered_2023 %>%

```
Create the dest_state dataframe that found the states of the destination cities in the flight data. 

Create the region_dest_state dataframe to divid each state into HHS regions taht correspond with the CDC data.

```{r HHS Names}


dest <- flights %>%
  separate(city2, into = c("city_name", "dest_state"), sep = ",") %>%
  arrange(dest_state) 
      

dest$dest_state <- as.character(dest$dest_state)  


for (i in 1:length(dest$dest_state)) {
  dest$dest_state[i] <- sub("^\\s+", "", dest$dest_state[i])  
}




dest <- dest %>%
  
  mutate(HHSregion = case_when(

## Correlation Analysis

Next, we attempt to correlate health-related deaths with travel data using linear regression models. This helps us see any potential relationships between travel and the deaths caused from flu, pneumonia, or COVID-19 deaths.

```{r}
flights_aggregate <- dest %>%
  group_by(HHSregion, Year, quarter) %>%
  summarise(total_passengers = sum(passengers, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

health_aggregate <- filtered_region %>%
  group_by(Jurisdiction, MMWRyear, Quarter) %>%
  summarise(total_deaths = sum(TotalDeaths, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

merged_data <- merge(flights_aggregate, health_aggregate, 
                     by.x = c("HHSregion", "Year", "quarter"), 
                     by.y = c("Jurisdiction", "MMWRyear", "Quarter"),
